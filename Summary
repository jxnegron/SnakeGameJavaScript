Created a Snake Game in JavaScript by following FreeCodeCamp's tutorial.
First, we set up our HTML to deploy our game.
Second, we used CSS to style the game components to give it a retro look.
Third, we used JavaScript to build the game logic to allow the snake to move and gain speed as the game progresses.
